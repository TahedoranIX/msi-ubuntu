## MSI-EC installation

In Ubuntu 23.10, I couldn't install with the command `make`, so I installed dkms, and used the parameter `make dkms-install`, after that, I could continue with the installation.

## Scripts

* performance_control: Change between different power modes (msi key)
* webcam_control: Enable/Disable camera (webcam key)
